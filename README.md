# Changelog


## [0.0.13] - 2025-07-08

### ? Added
- New global option: `useStdDev` (boolean, default `true`).
  - When enabled, average-based filters (`STW`, `TWA`, `TWS`) now use **standard deviation (z-score)** logic.
  - Allows outlier detection and better filtering of transient anomalies such as wave-induced speed variations.
- All average-based filters (e.g. `avgSpeedThresholdUp`, `avgTwaThresholdUp`) support z-score limits when `useStdDev` is active.

### ?? Changed
- Filters now dynamically switch behavior based on `useStdDev`:
  - If `true`: filters accept values within `Â± threshold` standard deviations from the mean.
  - If `false`: fallback to ratio comparisons like `current / avg`.

### ?? Affected Filters
| Signal | Time Window | Enabled By               | Upper Threshold             | Notes                        |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| STW    | `avgSpeedTimeWindow` | `useAvgSpeedThreshold` | `avgSpeedThresholdUp`       | Uses z-score or ratio        |
| TWA    | `avgTwaTimeWindow`   | `useAvgTwaThreshold`   | `avgTwaThresholdUp`         | Uses z-score or ratio        |
| TWS    | `avgTwsTimeWindow`   | `useAvgTwsThreshold`   | `avgTwsThresholdUp`         | Uses z-score or ratio        |

### ? Example
```json
{
  "useAvgSpeedThreshold": true,
  "avgSpeedTimeWindow": 5,
  "avgSpeedThresholdUp": 2,
  "useStdDev": true
}


## [0.0.11] - 2025-07-08

### Added
- This readme

## [0.0.10] - 2025-07-08

### Added
- **VMG Ratio Filtering**: Added support to filter recorded points based on the STW/VMG ratio. If VMG is negative and STW is positive, the ratio is set to 1000 to indicate invalid sailing direction.
- **Average Speed Time Window Filtering**: Added a second filter to discard data points when STW deviates too much from the average STW over a configurable time window.
- **New plugin options**:
  - `useVmgThreshold`: toggle VMG ratio filter.
  - `vmgPath`: custom path for VMG data.
  - `vmgRatioThresholdUp` and `vmgRatioThresholdDown`: thresholds for valid VMG ratio range.
  - `useAvgSpeedThreshold`: toggle average speed filter.
  - `avgSpeedTimeWindow`: size of time window for STW average.
  - `avgSpeedThresholdUp` and `avgSpeedThresholdDown`: thresholds for valid STW deviation.

### Fixed
- **setInterval leak on plugin reload**: Properly cancels the periodic recording loop when `stop()` is called by persisting `state.interval` and clearing it on shutdown. This prevents duplicated execution after changing plugin settings in Signal K.
